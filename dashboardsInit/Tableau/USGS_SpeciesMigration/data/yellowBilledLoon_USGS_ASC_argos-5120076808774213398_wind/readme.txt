This annotated dataset comes from the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and movebank.org/node/6607.

Terms of use for animal movement data in Movebank are defined by the study owners in the License Terms for the study. Terms of use for environmental datasets vary by provider; see below for details. When using these results in presentations or publications, acknowledge the use of Env-DATA and Movebank and cite Dodge et al. (2013).

Attributes from annotated environmental data:
Name: ECMWF Interim Full Daily SFC Wind (10 m above Ground U Component)
Description: Velocity of the east-west (zonal) component of wind at 10 m above the surface of the earth. Positive values indicate west to east flow. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.
Unit: m/s
No data values: NaN (interpolated)
Interpolation: inverse-distance-weighted

Name: ECMWF Interim Full Daily SFC Wind (10 m above Ground V Component)
Description: Velocity of the north-south (meridional) component of wind at 10 m above the surface of the earth. Positive values indicate south to north flow. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.
Unit: m/s
No data values: NaN (interpolated)
Interpolation: inverse-distance-weighted
