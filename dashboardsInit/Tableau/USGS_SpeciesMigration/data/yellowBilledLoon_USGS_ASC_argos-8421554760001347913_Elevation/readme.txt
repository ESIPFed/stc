This annotated dataset comes from the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and movebank.org/node/6607.

Terms of Use: Verify the terms of use for relevant tracking data and environmental datasets prior to presenting or publishing these data. Terms of use for animal movement data in Movebank are defined by the study owners in the License Terms for the study. Terms of use for environmental datasets vary by provider; see below for details. When using these results in presentations or publications, acknowledge the use of Env-DATA and Movebank and cite Dodge et al. (2013). Sample acknowledgement: "[source product/variable] values were annotated using the Env-DATA System on Movebank (movebank.org)." Please send copies of published work to support@movebank.org.
